Delete pods from alpha namespace which are not immutable.

Note: Any pod which uses elevated privileges and can store state inside the container is considered to be non-immutable.
###########
Pod solaris is immutable as it have readOnlyRootFilesystem: true so it should not be deleted.

Pod sonata is running with privileged: true and triton doesn't define readOnlyRootFilesystem: true so both break the concept of immutability and should be deleted.
