Try to create a pod using the template defined in /root/beta-pod.yaml in the namespace beta. This should result in a failure.
Troubleshoot and fix the OPA validation issue while creating the pod. You can update /root/beta-pod.yaml as necessary.

The Rego configuration map for OPA is in untrusted-registry under opa namespace.

NOTE: In the end pod need not to be successfully running but make sure that it passed the OPA validation and gets created.

If you inspect the rego file defined in the configmap called untrusted-registry, you will see that it denies repositories that do not begin with kodekloud.io/.
To fix this, update the image URL to kodekloud.io/ and then create the pod.

  - image: kodekloud.io/google-samples/node-hello:1.0
NOTE: The pod will now be created as it passes the policy checks. However, it will not run as such an image does not exist.
