A pod has been created in the omni namespace. However, there are a couple of issues with it.

The pod has been created with more permissions than it needs.
It allows read access in the directory /usr/share/nginx/html/internal causing an Internal Site to be accessed publicly.

To check this, click on the button called Site (above the terminal) and add /internal/ to the end of the URL.
Use the below recommendations to fix this.
Use the AppArmor profile created at /etc/apparmor.d/frontend to restrict the internal site.
There are several service accounts created in the omni namespace. Apply the principle of least privilege and use the service account with the minimum privileges (excluding the default service account).
Once the pod is recreated with the correct service account, delete the other unused service accounts in omni namespace (excluding the default service account).

You can recreate the pod but do not create a new service accounts and do not use the default service account.
##########

On the controlplane node, load the AppArmor profile: apparmor_parser -q /etc/apparmor.d/frontend The profile name used by this file is restricted-frontend (open the /etc/apparmor.d/frontend file to check).


To verify that the profile was successfully loaded, use the aa-status command:

root@controlplane:~# aa-status | grep restricted-frontend
   restricted-frontend
root@controlplane:~#
The pod should only use the service account called frontend-default as it has the least privileges of all the service accounts in the omni namespace (excluding default) The other service accounts, fe and frontend have additional permissions (check the roles and rolebindings associated with these accounts)

Use the below YAML File to re-create the frontend-site pod:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  annotations:
    container.apparmor.security.beta.kubernetes.io/nginx: localhost/restricted-frontend #Apply profile 'restricted-fronend' on 'nginx' container 
  labels:
    run: nginx
  name: frontend-site
  namespace: omni
spec:
  serviceAccount: frontend-default #Use the service account with least privileges
  containers:
  - image: nginx:alpine
    name: nginx
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html
      name: test-volume
  volumes:
  - name: test-volume
    hostPath:
       path: /data/pages
       type: Directory
Next, Delete the unused service accounts in the 'omni' namespace.

controlplane$ kubectl -n omni delete sa frontend
controlplane$ kubectl -n omni delete sa fe
