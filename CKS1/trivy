A number of pods have been created in the delta namespace. Using the trivy tool, which has been installed on the controlplane, identify and delete pods except the ones with least number of CRITICAL level vulnerabilities.

Note: Do not modify the objects in anyway other than deleting the ones that have critical vulnerabilities.
######

First, get all the images of pods running in the delta namespace:

$ kubectl -n delta get pods -o json | jq -r '.items[].spec.containers[].image'
Next, scan each image using trivy image command. For example:

$ trivy image --severity CRITICAL kodekloud/webapp-delayed-start
Don't delete the associated pod which image has a least number of CRITICAL vulnerabilities as compared to others.

For example, if kodekloud/webapp-delayed-start, httpd and nginx:1.16 have these vulnerabilities:

$ kubectl -n delta delete pod simple-webapp-1
$ kubectl -n delta delete pod simple-webapp-3
$ kubectl -n delta delete pod simple-webapp-4
Ignore pods which use images of lower severity such as HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW e.t.c
