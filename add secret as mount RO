To extract the secret, run: kubectl -n orion get secrets a-safe-secret -o jsonpath='{.data.CONNECTOR_PASSWORD}' | base64 --decode >/root/CKS/secrets/CONNECTOR_PASSWORD
One way that is more secure to distribute secrets is to mount it as a read-only volume.

Use the following YAML file to recreate the POD with secret mounted as a volume:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
    labels:
        name: app-xyz
    name: app-xyz
    namespace: orion
spec:
    containers:
        -
            image: nginx
            name: app-xyz
            ports:
            - containerPort: 3306
            volumeMounts: 
            - name: secret-volume
              mountPath: /mnt/connector/password
              readOnly: true
    volumes:
    - name: secret-volume
      secret:
        secretName: a-safe-secret
