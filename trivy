First, get all the images of pods running in the delta namespace:

$ kubectl -n delta get pods -o json | jq -r '.items[].spec.containers[].image'
Next, scan each image using trivy image command. For example:

$ trivy image --severity CRITICAL kodekloud/webapp-delayed-start
Don't delete the associated pod which image has a least number of CRITICAL vulnerabilities as compared to others.

For example, if kodekloud/webapp-delayed-start, httpd and nginx:1.16 have these vulnerabilities:

$ kubectl -n delta delete pod simple-webapp-1
$ kubectl -n delta delete pod simple-webapp-3
$ kubectl -n delta delete pod simple-webapp-4
Ignore pods which use images of lower severity such as HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW e.t.c
