Enable file_output in /etc/falco/falco.yaml on the controlplane node:

file_output:
  enabled: true
  keep_alive: false
  filename: /opt/security_incidents/alerts.log
Next, add the updated rule under the /etc/falco/falco_rules.local.yaml and hot reload the Falco service:

- rule: Write below binary dir
  desc: an attempt to write to any file below a set of binary directories
  condition: >
    bin_dir and evt.dir = < and open_write
    and not package_mgmt_procs
    and not exe_running_docker_save
    and not python_running_get_pip
    and not python_running_ms_oms
    and not user_known_write_below_binary_dir_activities
  output: >
    File below a known binary directory opened for writing (user=%user.name file_updated=%fd.name command=%proc.cmdline)
  priority: CRITICAL
  tags: [filesystem, mitre_persistence]
To perform hot-reload falco use 'kill -1 /SIGHUP':

$ kill -1 $(cat /var/run/falco.pid)
Alternatively, you can also restart the falco service by running:

$ systemctl restart falco
