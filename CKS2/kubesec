A pod definition file has been created at /root/CKS/simple-pod.yaml . Using the kubesec tool, 
generate a report for this pod definition file and fix the major issues so that the subsequent scan report no longer fails.
Once done, generate the report again and save it to the file /root/CKS/kubesec-report.txt


Remove the SYS_ADMIN capability from the container for the simple-webapp-1 pod in the POD definition file and re-run the scan.

controlplane $ kubesec scan /root/CKS/simple-pod.yaml > /root/CKS/kubesec-report.txt
The fixed report should PASS with a message like this:

[
  {
    "object": "Pod/simple-webapp-1.default",
    "valid": true,
    "fileName": "API",
    "message": "Passed with a score of 3 points",
    "score": 3,
  },
.
.
