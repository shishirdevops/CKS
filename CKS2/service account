A pod has been created in the gamma namespace using a service account called cluster-view. This service account has been granted additional permissions as compared to the default service account and can view resources cluster-wide on this Kubernetes cluster. While these permissions are important for the application in this pod to work, the secret token is still mounted on this pod.
Secure the pod in such a way that the secret token is no longer mounted on this pod. You may delete and recreate the pod.

Update the Pod to use the field automountServiceAccountToken: false

Using this option makes sure that the service account token secret is not mounted in the pod at the location /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount

Sample YAML shown below:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  labels:
    run: apps-cluster-dash
  name: apps-cluster-dash
  namespace: gamma
spec:
  containers:
  - image: nginx
    name: apps-cluster-dash
  serviceAccountName: cluster-view
  automountServiceAccountToken: false
