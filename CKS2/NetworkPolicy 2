A few pods have been deployed in the apps-xyz namespace. There is a pod called redis-backend which serves as the backend for the apps app1 and app2. The pod called app3 on the other hand, does not need access to this redis-backend pod. Create a network policy called allow-app1-app2 that will only allow incoming traffic from app1 and app2 to the redis-pod.
Make sure that all the available labels are used correctly to target the correct pods. Do not make any other changes to these objects.

Create a new network policy using the sample YAML file below:

kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: allow-app1-app2
  namespace: apps-xyz
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      tier: backend
      role: db
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          name: app1
          tier: frontend
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          name: app2
          tier: frontend
