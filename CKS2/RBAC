martin is a developer who needs access to work on the dev-a, dev-b and dev-z namespace. He should have the ability to carry out any operation on any pod in dev-a and dev-b namespaces. However, on the dev-z namespace, he should only have the permission to get and list the pods.
The current set-up is too permissive and violates the above condition. Use the above requirement and secure martin's access in the cluster. You may re-create objects, however, make sure to use the same name as the ones in effect currently.


The role called dev-user-access has been created for all three namespaces: dev-a, dev-b and dev-z. However, the role in the 'dev-z' namespace grants martin access to all operation on all pods. To fix this, delete and re-create the role using the following YAML:

apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
    name: dev-user-access
    namespace: dev-z
rules:
    -
        apiGroups:
            - ""
        resources:
            - pods
        verbs:
            - get
            - list
