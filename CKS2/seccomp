A pod has been created in the omega namespace using the pod definition file located at /root/CKS/omega-app.yaml. However, there is something wrong with it and the pod is not in a running state.
We have used a custom seccomp profile located at /var/lib/kubelet/seccomp/custom-profile.
json to ensure that this pod can only make use of limited syscalls to the Linux Kernel of the host operating system. 
However, it appears the profile does not allow the read and write syscalls. Fix this by adding it to the profile and use it to start the pod.

The path to the seccomp profile is incorrectly specified for the omega-app pod. As per the question, the profile is created at /var/lib/kubelet/seccomp/custom-profiles.json

controlplane $ kubectl -n omega describe omega-app

Fix the seccomp profile path in the POD Definition file:

securityContext:
      seccompProfile:
        localhostProfile: custom-profile.json
        type: Localhost
Next, update the custom-profile.json to allow 'read' and 'write' syscalls. Once done, you should see an output similar to below:

controlplane $ cat /var/lib/kubelet/seccomp/custom-profile.json | jq -r '.syscalls[].names[]' | grep -w write
write

controlplane $ cat /var/lib/kubelet/seccomp/custom-profile.json | jq -r '.syscalls[].names[]' | grep -w read 
read
Finally, re-create the pod

controlplane $ kubectl replace -f /root/CKS/omega-app.yaml
The POD should now run successfully.

NOTE: It may still run even if the above two syscalls are not added. However, adding the syscalls is required to successfully complete this question.
