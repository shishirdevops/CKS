On the controlplane node, an unknown process is bound to the port 8088. Identify the process and prevent it from running again by stopping and disabling any associated services.
Finally, remove the package that was responsible for starting this process.


Check the process which is bound to port 8088 on this node using netstat:

controlplane $ netstat -natulp | grep 8088
This shows that the the process openlitespeed is the one which is using this port. Check if any service is running with the same name:

controlplane $ systemctl list-units  -t service --state active | grep -i openlitespeed
lshttpd.service                    loaded active running OpenLiteSpeed HTTP Server
This shows that a service called openlitespeed is managed by lshttpd.service which is currently active.

Next, stop the service and disable it:

controlplane $ systemctl stop lshttpd
controlplane $ systemctl disable lshttpd
Finally, check for the package by the same name:

controlplane $ apt list --installed | grep openlitespeed
Uninstall the package:

controlplane $ apt remove openlitespeed -y
